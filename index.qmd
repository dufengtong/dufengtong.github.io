Hi! My name is Fengtong (Farah) Du, a PhD student in the [Janelia-JHU Joint Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://www.janelia.org/you-janelia/students-postdocs/joint-graduate-program), advised by [Carsen Stringer](https://www.janelia.org/people/carsen-stringer). 

My work bridges computational modeling and neuroscience, with a focus on understanding how visual information is represented in the brain, and how the brain learn from the outside world in an unsupervised way.

Outside the lab, I enjoy Chinese philosophy, Russian literature, writing and music. I also love occasional spontaneous adventure close to home.

Welcome to check out my [CV](assets/cv-dufengtong.pdf)!
